          Hello, here you will find information about my education, work experience and projects.
          I am a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience, focused on performance, reliability, and maintainability.
          Winner of the Parallel Programming Marathon, I bring a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures,
          concurrency,and metric-driven optimization. At Globo, I applied these principles to backend APIs supporting
          the recommendation ecosystem. At FUJB, I redesigned a system workflow, removing a third-party dependency and
          reducing operational costs by R$2,000 per month. My background as a teaching assistant and programming
          instructor
          reinforces disciplined problem-solving, precise solution design. In agile environments,I actively contribute
          to technical
          and architectural decisions, bringing relevant insights, learning from technical discussions and, delivering
          consistent
          solutions. I enjoy the process of conceiving, designing, and implementing software end-to-end, combining
          hands-on
          engineering with core computer-science foundations. Recently I assume a new position as "Data Scientist I" at
          Globo-
          exploring and building my path in Data & AI world! (>‿◠).<br><br>
          - Kowalski, what's our trajectory?<br>
          - 95% certain we're still doomed.<br>
          - And the, uh... other five percent?<br>
          - Adventure and glory like no penguins have ever seen before.<br>
          - I'll take that action.<br>

            As a Volunteer Professor for the “Programação 0” course at UERJ, I planned, organized, and delivered
            classes for freshmen with initial programming difficulties, structuring content in an accessible and
            needs-driven manner; I taught and reinforced core concepts of logic and software development-including
            algorithms, modularization, control flow, and fundamental problem-solving principles-while providing
            individualized support and close monitoring to identify knowledge gaps, deliver targeted explanations,
            and strengthen the logical foundation required for progression in programming courses.

            At Fundação Universitária José Bonifácio(FUJB), I worked as a Full-Stack Software Development Intern,
            designing and delivering end-to-end software modules-from requirements and architecture to implementation
            and
            testing-using C#,
            HTML, and CSS; I systematically refactored legacy components to improve long-term maintainability,
            designed and implemented the “Portal de Comprovante de Rendimento (Informe de Rendimento)” system, and
            architected and deployed an internal replacement for a third-party solution, achieving a recurring cost
            reduction of R$2,000 per month.
            working with: C#, ASP.NET, and SQL.

          This self-paced course provided a structured progression through core Java programming concepts across five
          modules, covering object-oriented programming fundamentals, control flow, recursion, and the design,
          compilation, and execution of Java applications; learning was reinforced through questionnaires,
          code challenges, and a comprehensive final exam, allowing flexible pacing while ensuring mastery
          of both theoretical foundations and applied programming skills.
