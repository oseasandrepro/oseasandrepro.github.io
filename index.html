      <p style="text-align: left">
        Hello, here you will find information about my education, work experience and projects.
        I am a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience, focused on performance, reliability, and maintainability.
        Winner of the Parallel Programming Marathon, I bring a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures,
        concurrency,and metric-driven optimization. At Globo, I applied these principles to backend APIs supporting
        the
        recommendation ecosystem. At FUJB, I redesigned a system workflow, removing a third-party dependency and
        reducing
        operational costs by R$2,000/month. My background as a teaching assistant and programming instructor
        reinforces
        disciplined problem-solving, precise solution design. In agile environments,I actively contribute to technical
        and architectural
        decisions, bringing relevant insights, learning from technical discussions and, delivering consistent
        solutions.
        I enjoy the process of conceiving, designing, and implementing software end-to-end, combining hands-on
        engineering
        with core computer-science foundations. Recently I assume a new position as "Data Scientist I" at Globo-
        exploring and building my path in Data & AI world! (>‿◠).

          As a Volunteer Professor for the “Programação 0” course at UERJ, I planned, organized, and delivered
          classes for freshmen with initial programming difficulties, structuring content in an accessible and
          needs-driven manner; I taught and reinforced core concepts of logic and software development-including
          algorithms, modularization, control flow, and fundamental problem-solving principles-while providing
          individualized support and close monitoring to identify knowledge gaps, deliver targeted explanations,
          and strengthen the logical foundation required for progression in programming courses.

          At Fundação Universitária José Bonifácio(FUJB), I worked as a Full-Stack Software Development Intern,
          designing and delivering end-to-end software modules—from requirements and architecture to implementation and
          testing—using C#,
          HTML, and CSS; I systematically refactored legacy components to improve long-term maintainability,
          designed and implemented the “Portal de Comprovante de Rendimento (Informe de Rendimento)” system, and
          architected and deployed an internal replacement for a third-party solution, achieving a recurring cost
          reduction of approximately R$2,000 per month.
          working with: C#, ASP.NET, and SQL.

          I provided hands-on technical guidance through code reviews and structured feedback,
          explained fundamental programming concepts using live examples, and strengthened my
          ability to analyze, evaluate, and debug solution approaches, consistently reinforcing good
          coding practices, algorithmic reasoning, pattern recognition, and critical problem-solving.

        During my graduation, I deliberately focused on mastering algorithms and the core disciplines
        that support the design, implementation, and long-term maintenance of high-quality software projects.
        I prioritized subjects that strengthened my algorithmic thinking, system decomposition, and analytical
        rigor. Disciplines that stand out:
      <ul>
        <li>Algorithms and Data Structures I and II</li>
        <li>Programming Languages I and II;</li>
        <li>Graph Algorithms;</li>

        This self-paced course provided a structured progression through core Java programming concepts across five
        modules,
        covering object-oriented programming fundamentals, control flow, recursion, and the design, compilation, and
        execution of Java applications; learning was reinforced through questionnaires,code challenges, and a
        comprehensive final exam, allowing flexible pacing while ensuring mastery of both theoretical foundations and
        applied programming skills.

          This repository documents the coursework and exercises developed throughout the “Algorithms: Theory, Analysis,
          and Implementation” course from USP, with strong emphasis on algorithmic rigor and theoretical foundations. It
          covers algorithm complexity, finiteness and correctness proofs, recursion and recurrence solving, fundamental
          data structures, classic search and sorting algorithms, graph theory and graph algorithms. The repository
          aggregates lecture materials, mathematical proofs, evaluated assessments, practical implementations, and
          exercises written in C. What stands out in this Repo is a text where I conduct my first regourous finitude and
          correctness analysis, of Selection-sort and Buble-Sort Algorithms - look at this link: <a
